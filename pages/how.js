                A valid visa is required for almost foreign travelers to
                Vietnam. Today, application for a Vietnam visa has become much
                easier since there are two options to go about this matter.

              <Text p textAlign="center">
                The traditional way would be directly contact the nearest
                Vietnam Embassy to apply for one. Or, those who wish to save
                some time could consider applying for a visa on arrival. With
                the second option, you will need to apply online for a visa
                approval letter in advance, and then get the visa stamped onto
                your passport at the arrival airport in Vietnam.
